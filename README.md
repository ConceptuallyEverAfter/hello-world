Intro to GitHub repository

Hey all just a test for branching a repo. A little bit about myself; A skill of mine is figuring out solutions through logic. A conceptual mastermind for marketing, design, and problem solving. Taken from being trained in color and conceptual theory and studying Mr. Milton Glaser, these skills reach out and are well understood by a broad range of fields.
Let me know if I can be of assistance.

Changes - The only change in this branch is added writing here and the script above.
